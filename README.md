Scala SALAD
===========

SALAD: 
Slick
Argonaut
Lift
Angular
Derby

The project is meant to be a step-by-step-no-steps-missed walkthrough to create a generic but useful setup for multi-tier web-based Scala application, using  Derby as a database backend, Slick as an FRM toolkit and argonaut as a Json processor. 

See: [Walkthrough instructions](https://github.com/yuriylesyuk/scala-salad/wiki).
